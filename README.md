## 📖 Introduction

The Color Game is a test of both speed and perception. It challenges your brain to correctly identify the color of the text rather than what the text says. This project is an excellent way to practice GUI development in Python and understand basic event handling.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. When you start the game, you'll see a word displayed in a certain color.
2. Type the **color** of the text in the input field and press Enter.
3. You score a point if your input matches the color of the text.
4. The game lasts for 30 seconds, and your goal is to score as many points as possible before time runs out.

## 💻 Installation

To run the Color Game, you need Python installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-game.git
    cd color-game
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    - This project only requires Python and the `tkinter` library, which is included with most Python installations.

## 🚀 Usage

To start the game, simply run the script:

```bash
python color_game.py
```

This will open a window where you can play the Color Game.
